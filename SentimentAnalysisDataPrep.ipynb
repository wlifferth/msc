      "I think this is the first book I've ever hated. And that list is pretty short. As a child, it really distressed me - I didn't understand much of it, and it confused me why its tone was so very different from the other Narnia books. Then, when I reread it a few years ago, it just pissed me off. The message about religious pluralism is refreshing, sure, but the book just plain reads wrong, and I will probably never get over Lewis's treatment of Susan. I guess if you don't believe in God, you deserve to lose your entire family in a train crash. Awesome.I suppose there is some hope in that Susan did not die - maybe her family's gruesome deaths will help her find God, and then a train will kill her too, and she'll join Peter, Edmund, and Lucy in Aslan's country! Bleargh.\n",

      "Poorly written: This 60 pages pamphlet is a copy and paste version of the actual 372 pages book. I'm not sure if this was intended to be a supplement to the book or a summary of the book. I was looking for the book, not knowing what it looked like; therefore, I thought since this one had the same name and publication company, it was what we needed. After reading the book and noticing the references to pages and tables that weren't in the book, further investigation was taken. If you are looking for the book in order to study for a licensing exam, this is not the one. In addition, it was poorly written, hard to follow, and contained many misspelled words.\n",

      "Breathing is ALL WRONG!: I recently bought this album and as a trained singer, was pretty impressed. One thing I found VERY annoying though, was her breathing. She breathes pretty loud and at times it sounds as if she is gasping for air. In \"Leave (Get Out)\" her first single, you can hear her lick her lips ( or something of that sort!). But you do have to take into consideration that she was only 13 when she recorded the album.But JoJo has a very nice Pop voice with an R&B; twist, which is fun to listen too. My personal faorite song is \"Homeboy\" which I am sure many young girls can relate too. You know how most Pop singers don't write their own songs? Well surprisingly JoJo wrote or co-wrote a few of her songs including \" Keep on Keepin' On\" which is pretty insperational. But other songs kind of flop, because they are either boring or have lame lyrics.I do reccomend this Album if you want to entertain yourself or friends, but not if you are extremely critical when it comes to singing technique.\n",

This book is the worst children's book I have ever read.It is not about sharing. It is about giving everything away that is yours, and then people will like you. Seems very communistic to me. My 4 year old also wanted me to read it to him. After I did, we had a big discussion about how you should not have to give all of your things away to have friends, and those are not the type of people you want to be your friend anyway. A sharing book should be about letting others use your toys, or other things. Not giving something very precious to you away. This book is absolutely aweful!\n",

The thing about this one is, these recipes are not dairy free and egg free, etc., like it claims, but almost all of them have this stuff in them but with suggested substitutions to the side on some of them. And then on some the author says you can't substitute eggs in this one...well then why is it even in there?? It is deceptive and I wouldn't buy it.\n",

Yet in the world of fiction, this does not happen. Somebody writes a novel and it's supposed to be theirs & theirs alone. You touch my book, I slap you with a writ. Yeah? Yeah! But why can't someone else come along & write their version of your story? This is what Kathy Acker was revolutionalistically suggesting by rewriting very badly Great Expectations. The idea is that you put in a few jazz chords, take out that tiresome riff and add a new one, get rid of the sub plot about the neighbour's wife's suspicions that her son was a rent boy - good god, that was terrible - increase the bpm by a little bit not too much.Well, there is stuff like Pride & Prejudice with Zombies but that's just silly. I was thinking more along the lines of re-doing The Lovely Bones where she doesn't die, so it's more cheerful, or rewriting Philip Roth novels so that the hero has great relationships with women and only has positive things to say about them - but of course keep the same plot and characters. That's important otherwise you might as well just write your own book. Maybe it wouldn't work with books, but it's completely normal in the world of pop songs. In fact songwriters are disappointed if no one else does their stuff. And the songwriters are artists but they don't go around saying \"the guitar break has to stay\" or \"every word of this song has to be sung in the same way by the same person every time\". How silly would it be if authors demanded the same printer is used every time their novel is printed. Absurd. So - I'm quite excited about this - I'm thinking of doing a version of We Need to Talk About Kevin in which they do actually talk about Kevin, and they never buy him any archery lessons, so he puts his talents to use elsewhere and becomes a pretty good banjo player. He joins this little newgrass band, they end up doing really well and one of their albums gets nominated for a Grammy, but it doesn't win. And nobody dies. I think that's a much better version.\n",

      "I have no words for how unendurably horrible and boring this book is. Armand knows only how to cry, beg people to love him and seemingly can't get his head around Christ. He is a pathetic wanker that can do nothing on his own, with an unhealthy obsession with Lestat...whom he both loves and hates. He's 17 when turned a vampire, but when he's 500 years old and still 17 in his head, all you want is to strangle him. Apart from that - the narrator being an idiot and a madman - the book lacks plot. Absolutely nothing happens. When alluded to things of interest, Armand/Anne Rice is quick to let the reader know that the matter has already been told in this or that book, and anyway Armand Is Too Jealous Of Lestat to bother recounting it all. The ending is also absolute shit. I had hope until the very end, but...No, Armand is still a whiny wanker that needs to grow a backbone.\n",

      "Great price, easy to install, works, lacks instructions: Many of the reviewers here seem upset that this part fails. This part is designed to fail. This is a good thing. After having my garage door inspected after the original part failed, we determined the springs were not tight enough, thus making the door too heavy. So, this $15 part failed instead of the screw itself or the $200 opener. I'll take replacing a $15 part any day.This part is easy to install, and the tips in other reviews are very helpful, but this part should come with instructions.\n",

      "Fun to play with: I bought this toy for my disabled daughter for Christmas. When I received it I played with it for at least an hour before I wrapped it. It takes some getting used to, pushing the button and recording at just the right time, and with the right emphasis on your words. It is a great idea and once you get used to it it's a lot of fun. However, I don't know if my disabled daughter will be able to work it right. We'll find out on Christmas morning! I don't think this would be a good toy for a young child, under 3, but for older children I think it would be great.\n",

      "Another fine example of Lori Wick's exceptional writing. Not. What is wrong with her? Can't she make her characters anything but perfect? Lily is a stupid, weak, and silly girl who is so \"spiritual\" but is so unbelievably perfect that you don't really care for her at all. Her problems (ha) brought no sympathy from me whatsoever and I was sickened by her character. The girl got majorly sunburned over her own \"obedient\" idiocy and then (after spending who-knows-how-long in the hospital recovering, finally is released)goes to church and hears a convicting song after which she determines to be hard on herself for not attending church (while she was in the hospital, unable to move?). Where is the sense in that? Also, if you know you're burning to a crisp in the sun, don't you think you would have the common sense to get out of it? Her conversations with her father made me hopping mad. What kind of father would tell you that you can't EAT until you master the rules of golf? Seriously. Mrs. Wick just wanted to create dramatic situations that would allow Gabe to rescue his stupid heroine so you could oooh and ahh over the romance of it. Blech! I don't think she ever realized that in order to create a truly dramatic situation, you must first have characters people care about and second, have a believable reason for the situation to occur. I'm sorry, but this book deserves a review like this. It is truly something I don't believe she should be proud of. \n",

      "I cannot understand how this book is getting such rave reviews. I could barely finish it, I wanted to pull my hair out with boredom! The characters were so silly and stupid that you just want to smack them in the head, especially Tara. Give me a break woman, how is it that you accept living with a man who dotes on his cat while spewing verbal abuses at you in the same second? Ridiculous. And really, Marian Keyes, all the unnecessary detail...you're killing me. I was skimming through passage after passage after passage of text that meant absolutely nothing to me and added absolutely nothing to the story. I mean, this is a BIG book - 600 pages - for a story that could have been cut down to about 270-300 pages! I could not wrap my head around all the chapters that I could've literally torn right out of the book and still had a complete, full story intact. And Lorcan...WHO THE F**K is Lorcan?! I spent more than three quarters of the book reading random chapters about this man who disgusted me to no end, only for his \"purpose\" to be revealed in the last few chapters of a 600 page book. REALLY?! Are you kidding me right now? He is unbelievably sickening, I cannot even begin to imagine how stupid women need to be in order to fall for this man based on looks ONLY. I mean really, nothing...NOTHING...else is redeeming about him but his looks, and even that, I find hard to believe that he's so good looking you lose sight of everything else. Shoot me now. The only thing that kept me going at one point was the interaction and later, relationship, between Katherine and Joe. Finally, something worth reading in this book. Something sweet, and pure, with the regular ups and downs, but at least realistic and normal in this great spectacle of a book Keyes wrote. I do not recommend this book to anyone, and I am disappointed at the amount of rave reviews it's gotten that fooled me into buying it and wasting my time.\n",
